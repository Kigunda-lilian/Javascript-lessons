<!-- Classes
JavaScript is an object oriented programming language. Everything in JavScript is an object, with its properties and methods. We create class to create an object. A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects. We instantiate a class to create an object. The class defines attributes and the behavior of the object, while the object, on the other hand, represents the class. -->

<!--  Once we create a class we can create object from it whenever we want. Creating an object from a class is called class instantiation.-->

<!-- In the object section, we saw how to create an object literal. Object literal is a singleton. If we want to get a similar object , we have to write it. However, class allows to create many objects. This helps to reduce amount of code and repetition of code. -->
