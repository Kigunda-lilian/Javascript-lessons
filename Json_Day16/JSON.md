<!-- JSON
JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. The JSON syntax is derived from JavaScript object notation syntax, but the JSON format is text or string only. JSON is a light weight data format for storing and transporting. JSON is mostly used when data is sent from a server to a client. JSON is an easier-to-use alternative to XML. -->
