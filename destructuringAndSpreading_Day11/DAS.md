Destructuring is a way to unpack arrays, and objects and assigning to a distinct variable.  -->
<!-- Spread or Rest Operator
When we destructure an array we use the spread operator(...) to get the rest elements as array. In addition to that we use spread operator to spread arr elements to another array. -->
