<!-- Local scope

 <!-- In practice, you often need to create many similar objects like the person object. -->
 <!-- To do that, you can use a constructor function to define a custom type and the new operator to create multiple objects from this type. -->
 <!--  Technically speaking, a constructor function is a regular function with the following convention:-->
 <!-- The name of a constructor function starts with a capital letter like Person, Document, etc. -->
 <!-- A constructor function should be called only with the new operator. -->
 <!--Note that ES6 introduces the class keyword that allows you to define a custom type. And classes are just syntactic sugar over the constructor functions with some enhancements.  -->
